# 🚀 Deployment Summary - Phishing Detection System

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Frontend:** Deployed on Netlify at https://phish66.netlify.app
⏳ **Backend:** Ready for Railway deployment

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Created Railway Configuration Files

- **`Procfile`** - Tells Railway how to start your Flask app
- **`runtime.txt`** - Specifies Python version (3.11.9)
- **`railway.json`** - Railway-specific configuration

### 2. Updated Backend Code (`app.py`)

- ✅ Configured CORS to allow requests from `https://phish66.netlify.app`
- ✅ Updated to use Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- ✅ Set production-ready settings

### 3. Created Comprehensive Guides

- **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - Complete step-by-step deployment instructions
- **`QUICK_DEPLOY.md`** - Quick reference checklist
- **`FRONTEND_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`** - How to connect frontend to Railway backend

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### `app.py` Changes:

1. **CORS Configuration (lines 18-32):**
   ```python
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
       'https://phish66.netlify.app',
       'http://localhost:3000',
       'http://localhost:5000'
   ]
   
   CORS(app, resources={
       r"/*": {
           "origins": ALLOWED_ORIGINS,
           "methods": ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
           "allow_headers": ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
           "supports_credentials": True
       }
   })
   ```

2. **Port Configuration (lines 574-591):**
   ```python
   # Get port from environment variable (Railway provides this)
   port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
   
   # Use debug=False in production
   debug_mode = os.environ.get('FLASK_ENV') != 'production'
   app.run(debug=debug_mode, host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
   ```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (15 minutes)

1. **Push code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for Railway deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway:**
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Wait for deployment (3-5 minutes)

3. **Get your Railway URL:**
   - Click on your service
   - Go to Settings → Domains
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Copy the URL (e.g., `https://phishformer-production.up.railway.app`)

### Step 2: Update Frontend (5 minutes)

1. **Update API URL in your frontend:**
   - File: `components/detection/url-scanner.tsx`
   - Line 38: Change `http://localhost:5000` to your Railway URL

2. **Or use environment variables (recommended):**
   - Add to Netlify: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app`
   - Update code: `const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000"`

3. **Deploy frontend changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update API URL to Railway backend"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Test Everything (5 minutes)

1. Visit https://phish66.netlify.app
2. Test the URL scanner feature
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Railway logs show requests

## 🔗 Important URLs

| Service | URL | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Frontend (Netlify) | https://phish66.netlify.app | ✅ Live |
| Backend (Railway) | *To be generated* | ⏳ Pending |
| Railway Dashboard | https://railway.app/dashboard | - |
| GitHub Repository | *Your repo URL* | - |

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

Your backend exposes these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | API information |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/metrics` | GET | Model performance metrics |
| `/predict` | POST | Predict if URL is phishing |
| `/api/download-model` | GET | Download model file |
| `/api/download-all` | GET | Download all files (ZIP) |

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: CORS Error
**Solution:** Backend already configured for `https://phish66.netlify.app`. Ensure you're using the correct URL.

### Issue: 502 Bad Gateway
**Solution:** Check Railway logs. App might be starting up or crashed.

### Issue: Model Not Loading
**Solution:** Ensure `saved_models/` folder is committed to Git.

### Issue: Build Fails on Railway
**Solution:** Check `requirements.txt` has all dependencies with correct versions.
